# Mirrors
A fun strategy game written using Game Maker 8

# Viewing the Source Code
Mirrors is programmed using Game Maker 8.1 by [YoYo Games](http://www.yoyogames.com/). While you can no longer buy Game Maker 8, you can import the project into Game Maker Studio and run the game that way. Or, you may have already purchased Game Maker 8 (like me) before it was made obsolete.
